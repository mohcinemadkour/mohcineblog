title: Biography


Mohcine's interests span machine learning, computational phenotyping, and its applications to domains where one has to draw inferences from observing a complex, real-world systems that evolve over time. He enjoys challenging and complex data analysis, data mining, machine learning and data visualization tasks. He is now using cutting edge deep neural networks and machine learning technics for improving patient outcome and experience in perioperative environments by predicting the risk of developing kidney injury and other complications after surgical procedures.

Research interests:

- Machine Learning
