title: About

This is a personal blog I've started to share thoughts on data analytics and applied mathematics.

I am a data scientist at the University of Florida, School of Medicine. I finnished two years of postdoctoral studies in Biomedical Informatcs at the Univesity of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. My work was was about applying Ontologies and Semantic web technologies for information extraction and annotaion. I also finnished one and half year experience as a Postdoc working on industrial artificial intelligence and control optimization at the engineering technology department of the University of Houston.

I work on building Big Data infrastructure solutions and data analytics algorithms, as well as productionizing machine learning models. My research emphasized predictive modelling and automation of learning for big data system. I am not married to a particular software platform or language, though my day-to-day weapon of choice is Python. I take responsibility of different roles in the college of Medicine at the University of Florida. I have a well rounded perspective to evaluate different statistical methods, develop different study designs, and interpret and communicate results to the scientific public and I have accumulated a multiple yaers of experience throughout my different job roles. 

As analytic lead, I predict and assess postoperative risks of major complications such as acute kidney injury and sepsis. I manage a Mirth Connect interface engine to stream and transpose EHR data, and I develop and manage big data pipeline that involve data storage, communication, query processing, and real time data prediction using Apache spark, kafka, cassandra, and zookeper. My PhD degree in computer science in addition to my three years training experience as postdoctoral fellow in biomedical informatic, provided me with the skills to understand theory behind computational approaches in big data environments and apply machine learning  in engineering  and medical and settings. I am very interested in the role.
