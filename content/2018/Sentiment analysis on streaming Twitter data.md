This tutorial will teach you how to build sentiment analysis algorithms with Apache Spark. We will be doing data transformation using Python and Apache Spark 2, and we will be classifying tweets as happy or sad using a Gradient Boosting algorithm. The solution is going to use many different components in the HDF/HDP stack including NiFi, Solr, Spark, and Zeppelin, and it will also utilize libraries that are available in the Open Source Community.

Gradient Boosting is a versatile technique that can be applied to many classification problems. 

# Apache Spark 
Apache Sparkis a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. Designed for large-scale data processing, it run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk. Spark can run on Hadoop, Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3. Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports acyclic data flow and in-memory computing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. You can learn more about spark at their quick start guide
